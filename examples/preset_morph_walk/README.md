# Preset Walkabout (Bus Glue ➜ Crunch Room ➜ Ambient Glass)

This sketch drifts through three Horizon scenes while Serial keeps score. It is
part study guide, part tour diary:

- **Bus Glue** — gluey center, polite air, limiter watching the gates.
- **Crunch Room** — roomy snarl with a top-end grin and a wider sway.
- **Ambient Glass** — glassy halo that exhales on the sides.

Each scene parks for ~6.5 seconds, then morphs for ~4 seconds toward the next
stop. No knobs; just headphones and patience. Use it to hear how width,
dynamic-width breathing, tilt, air, dirt, and limiter ceiling blend together
when you move slowly instead of jumping presets.

## Wiring (same as the other Horizon demos)

- Teensy 4.x + SGTL5000 Audio Shield
- I2S in → `AudioHorizon` → I2S out
- Serial at 115200 baud for the play-by-play text

## Why this exists

Students kept asking how the presets in `presets/` map to real-space moves.
This walkabout lets you hear those parameters stretch in real time. It’s a
lo-fi DJ set: lazy crossfades, zero crowd work, all about the details.
